        <li>👥 There are two people who play the game.</li>
        <li>🎲 At each player's turn, they can either roll the dice or keep their present score.</li>
        <li>➕ If the person rolls the dice, the number they get is added to their score.</li>
        <li>🎉 If a person rolls a 1, their score goes back to 0 and their turn is over right away.</li>
        <li>🔄 The person can keep rolling the dice until he or she decides to stop or rolls a 1.</li>
        <li>💰 When a person chooses to keep their score, their current score is added to their total score, and the other player takes their turn.</li>
        <li>🏁 The game goes on until one person gets a score that has already been set, usually 100 or 200.</li>
        <li>🎉 At the end of the game, the winner is the person with the most points.</li>
