# Roll Rush

Roll Rush is a dice game for two players. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a target score, usually 100 or 200 points.

## How to Play

At the start of each turn, the player can choose to roll the dice or keep their current score. If the player chooses to roll, the number on the dice is added to their current score. If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends immediately and their score goes back to 0.

The player can keep rolling the dice as many times as they want, but they must choose to stop and keep their current score before rolling a 1 or their turn ends.

When the player chooses to keep their score, their current score is added to their total score, and the other player takes their turn.

The game continues until one player reaches the target score. The winner is the player with the most points.
